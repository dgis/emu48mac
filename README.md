Emu48mac is a port of the excellent Emu48 HP calculator emulator for OS X.

The emulator ran fine until OS X 10.6 but unfortunately support for recent versions of OS X is lacking.

This is a branch of the Sourceforge code in an attempt to get the compilation process running on OS X Maverick.
There are some depricated code sections that need to be replaced. Any Xcode experts interested in restoring the
emulator of the iconic HP calculators?
